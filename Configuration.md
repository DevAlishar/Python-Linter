# Django Linters Comparison

Let's walk through how to enable Django-specific linting features for each of the linters mentioned and provide a comparison of these linters.

---

## 1. **flake8-django**
### Installation:
```bash
pip install flake8 flake8-django
```

### Configuration:
1. Create a `.flake8` configuration file in the root of your Django project:
   ```ini
   [flake8]
   max-line-length = 88
   exclude = migrations, __pycache__, *.pyc, env
   extend-ignore = E203, W503
   plugins = flake8_django
   ```

### Usage:
You can run `flake8` normally, and it will automatically check for Django-specific issues.

```bash
flake8 .
```

---

## 2. **pylint-django**
### Installation:
```bash
pip install pylint pylint-django
```

### Configuration:
1. Create a `.pylintrc` configuration file:
   ```ini
   [MASTER]
   load-plugins=pylint_django
   django-settings-module=my_project.settings
   ```

   Replace `my_project.settings` with your actual Django settings module path.

### Usage:
Run `pylint` with your Django project:
```bash
pylint my_project
```

---

## 3. **djLint**
### Installation:
```bash
pip install djlint
```

### Usage:
Run `djlint` on your Django templates:
```bash
djlint templates/
```

For formatting templates:
```bash
djlint --reformat templates/
```

You can add `djlint` to a pre-commit hook for continuous linting and formatting.

---

## 4. **mypy (with Django plugin)**
### Installation:
```bash
pip install mypy django-stubs
```

### Configuration:
1. Create a `mypy.ini` configuration file:
   ```ini
   [mypy]
   plugins =
       mypy_django_plugin.main

   [mypy.plugins.django-stubs]
   django_settings_module = "my_project.settings"
   ```

   Replace `my_project.settings` with the actual path to your settings module.

### Usage:
Run `mypy` to check types in your Django project:
```bash
mypy .
```

## Comparison of Django Linters

| Linter          | Special Features                             | Django-Specific Checks                     | Ease of Use  | Best For                           | Type Checking |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------|---------------|
| **flake8-django** | Lightweight, extends `flake8`               | Yes, checks models, views, settings, etc.  | Easy         | Enforcing style and best practices | No            |
| **pylint-django** | Full-featured, deep integration with Django | Yes, understands ORM, views, forms, etc.   | Moderate     | Catching logical errors in Django  | No            |
| **djLint**       | Lints and formats Django templates           | Yes, template validation and formatting    | Easy         | Handling Django template errors    | No            |
| **mypy (with django-stubs)** | Type checking with Django integration | Yes, type hinting for models, views, etc.   | Moderate     | Enforcing type safety in Django    | Yes           |

### Key Differences:
- **flake8-django** is lightweight and primarily focused on style and best practice enforcement.
- **pylint-django** offers deeper Django integration, understanding complex Django structures like the ORM and views, which makes it better for catching logical errors.
- **djLint** is unique in that it focuses entirely on Django templates, ensuring HTML and template syntax correctness.
- **mypy** (with Django plugin) is the only linter that provides static type checking, helping ensure type correctness across your Django models, views, and settings.

### Recommendations:
- **For general-purpose linting**: Use `flake8-django` for a lightweight and fast solution.
- **For deeper Django checks**: Use `pylint-django`, especially if you want more detailed insight into your Django project.
- **For templates**: Use `djLint` if you work heavily with Django templates and need linting for those.
- **For type safety**: Use `mypy` with `django-stubs` if you want to add static typing to your Django code.
